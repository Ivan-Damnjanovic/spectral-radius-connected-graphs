# spectral-radius-connected-graphs

This is a `SageMath` implementation of an algorithm that verifies the claim that no connected threshold graph can attain the maximum spectral radius on the set of connected graphs with a prescribed order and size apart from the one or two graphs obtained by a well-known construction.
